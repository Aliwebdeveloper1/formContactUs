# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Options

## Current Issue: 404 NOT_FOUND

The monorepo approach with both frontend and backend in one Vercel deployment is causing issues. Here are three solutions:

## 🎯 **Option 1: Frontend Only (Recommended for Quick Fix)**

**Current Setup**: Frontend-only deployment with localStorage fallback

### Steps:
1. **Current vercel.json is configured for frontend-only**
2. **Your contact form will save to localStorage** (working offline mode)
3. **Deploy immediately** - no backend needed

### Test:
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Fill out contact form
- Data saves to browser localStorage
- Message: "Your message has been saved locally..."

## 🌐 **Option 2: Separate Backend Deployment**

Deploy backend separately on Railway, Render, or another Vercel project.

### Steps:

#### A. Deploy Backend to Railway (Free):
1. **Go to https://railway.app**
2. **Connect GitHub** and select your repo
3. **Deploy from `backend/` folder**
4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-frontend.vercel.app
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

#### B. Update Frontend:
1. **Add Environment Variable in Vercel**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
   ```
2. **Redeploy frontend**

---

## 🔄 **Option 3: Serverless Functions (Advanced)**

Use Vercel's serverless functions for the backend.

### Steps:
1. **Create `api/contact.js`** (Vercel serverless function)
2. **Move MongoDB logic to serverless functions**
3. **Update vercel.json** for serverless functions

## ✅ **Quick Solution (5 minutes)**

**For immediate fix, use Option 1:**

### Current Status:
- ✅ Frontend deploys successfully
- ✅ Contact form works with localStorage
- ✅ Beautiful UI and validation
- ⚠️ Data saves locally (not to database)

### Test Your Deployment:
1. **Visit**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. **Fill out form** and submit
3. **Should see**: "Your message has been saved locally"
4. **Check browser console**: `viewAllLeads()` to see saved data

---

## 🛠️ **Next Steps:**

### Immediate (Working Solution):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Frontend-only deployment with localStorage"
git push origin main
```
- Vercel will redeploy
- Contact form will work with localStorage

### Later (Full Solution):
- Choose Option 2 or 3 for database integration
- Deploy backend separately
- Connect frontend to backend API

## 🔍 **Debug Current Issue:**

If still getting 404:
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** → Project → Functions tab
2. **Look for build errors**
3. **Verify frontend build succeeds**
4. **Check if `frontend/build` directory exists**

Your frontend should deploy successfully with the current configuration! 🎉
